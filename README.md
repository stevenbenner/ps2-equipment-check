# PlanetSide 2 Equipment Check

This is a tool to check all of the members of my [PlanetSide 2](https://www.planetside2.com/) outfit and determine if they have the equipment required for participating in specialized squad/platoon game play. It uses the [census.daybreakgames.com](https://census.daybreakgames.com/) API to pull outfit and character information.
